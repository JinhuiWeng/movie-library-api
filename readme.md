# movie-library-api

A Node.js backend api from https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node.git

##
First successfully deployed with Heroku but discovered it was no longer free. Then tried to deploy vercel without success. 
Now successfully deployed with Fly.io as backend api for my frontend project [git](https://github.com/JinhuiWeng/movie-library.git) - [movie-library](https://movie-library-gules.vercel.app).

##Lesson Learned
I need to play around with backend source code during each change and research for errors.
Through the process, I have experienced basic Node.js and its structure, Environment Variables, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) etc.
